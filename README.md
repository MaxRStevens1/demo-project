# demo-project
Personal project turned into a tech demo of sorts. Contains a basic gui and some cool pathfinding / level generation.


# Use
Download and run the jar file, no further set up needed!

# Tips
Welcome to a graphical, pathfinding, and gui demo.

Move around using a computer numpad or arrowkeys

If your key presses are not registering, try clicking on the panel and pressing shifttab

Movement is 8 directional, but there should be no issue if you are using arrow keys

If you want to pan around the map without moving the charecter, press caps locks

Type h into the bottom and press enter to see a help message similar to this one.

Type c if you want to clear the textbox above the bottom textbox.
