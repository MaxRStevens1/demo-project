# demo-project
Personal project turned into a tech demo of sorts. Contains a basic gui and some cool pathfinding / level generation.



# Controls and tips <br>
Move around using a computer numpad or arrowkeys
You have to type a name into the smaller text box on the bottom of the panel to start moving.
If your key presses are not registering, try clicking on the panel and pressing shifttab.
Movement is 8 directional, but there should be no issue if you are using arrow keys.
If you want to pan around the map without moving the charecter, press caps locks .
Type h into the smaller textbox and press enter to see this message again. Type c if you want to clear textbox.
