# demo-project
Personal project turned into a tech demo of sorts. Contains a basic gui and some cool pathfinding / level generation.



# Controls and tips <br>
Move around using a computer numpad or arrowkeys
If your key presses are not registering, try clicking on the panel and pressing shifttab
Movement is 8 directional, but there should be no issue if you are using arrow keys
If you want to pan around the map without moving the charecter, press caps locks 
Type h into the textbox below and press enter to see this message again. Type c if you want to clear this textbox
